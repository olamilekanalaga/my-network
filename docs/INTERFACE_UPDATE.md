# People-first interface update

The main Next.js application now uses a cream, lime, ink, and lavender palette with stronger typography, clear borders, and responsive goal shortcuts.

Choose Business developer, Business owner, Recruiter, or Job seeker on Home. The choice persists locally and changes the welcome message, suggested network searches, and primary shortcut. These are personal workspace preferences, not account permissions or a public job board. Searches use existing saved records; no role creates fictional vacancies or candidates.

Existing contacts, import, opportunity tracking, follow-ups, privacy controls, and optional integrations remain available.

## Deploy on Vercel

Import `olamilekanalaga/My-Network` from GitHub, select branch `main`, keep the root directory as the repository root, and deploy with the Next.js preset. `vercel.json` specifies the install and build commands.

The demo works without environment variables and saves fictional records in the browser. For authenticated live storage, configure the Supabase variables listed in `.env.example`, apply `supabase/migrations/001_network.sql`, and configure the deployed URL in Supabase Auth. Optional AI and Google Contacts integrations require their documented credentials and provider configuration. Never commit credential values.

Validation for this update: TypeScript check, production build, and all 17 existing tests passed. See the task report for browser and deployment results.
